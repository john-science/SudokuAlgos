SudokuAlgos
===========

 * A Java library to create Sudoku puzzles of a desired difficulty.

# Abstract

SudokuAlgos is a collection of algorithms to create and solve Sudoku puzzles. The Sudoku puzzle can be solved arbitrarily for any starting position, given that the starting position obeys the three rules of Sudoku. Once any arbitrary Sudoku puzzle can be solved, it is possible to generate an original Sudoku puzzle of desired difficulty. The methods used in this library are based on several published papers in combination with original research. The focus of this API is to be easy to use, performant, and always mathematically correct.
